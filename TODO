Status - Right now it's a Result (),raw::status. What should it be?
Create preulude - once there's more of an API
Panic safety - Cargo option for abort-on-panic should work
Naming - should we change naming and casing of structs (SnakeCase) and kill caps on enums?
Bitfields - bitfield! macro 
Trampolines - we need to get libffi (closures.c) connected to generate trampolines at runtime
              in order to wrap safe Rusty APIs into the C funcptrs for interfaces
Iterators - At least common linked lists should have iterators impl'd on them,
            even in the raw interface.
